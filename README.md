# UCLA_PhD_Template 
This is the LaTeX template for UCLA Ph.D. thesis.
A 2024-Updated template to write a UCLA PhD Dissertation w/ Overleaf. Credit goes to original developer, John Heidemann and @uclathes. I Just made this a little cleaner/easier to use. 

These are the lyrics to HorsegiirL's 2024 smash hit Obsessed:

O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
I'm obsessed, obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
Obsessed with you lately
I look at you
More than just a friend
I think about holding your hand
I lose myself, in your pretty red eyes
And when you notice me, will you finally realize?
I'd follow you everywhere you go
Come back some more, like a little yo-yo
I lose myself, in your pretty red eyes
And when will you notice me, will you finally realize?
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
I'm obsessed, obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
Obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
I'm obsessed, obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
Obsessed with you lately
I wonder, would you mind if I put your picture on my wall?
And I no longer fight the high, I get butterflies when you call
Will you be my valentine?
Wanna be more than just a friend?
In case you didn't realize
Let me spell it out for you again
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
I'm obsessed, obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
Obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
I'm obsessed, obsessed with you lately
O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D, baby
Obsessed with you lately
